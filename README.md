# TODO_list
Using springboot 
Set up a new Spring Boot project
You can use the Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) to create a new Spring Boot project. Select the following dependencies
Spring Web
Spring Data JPA
H2 Database (for an in-memory database, or you can choose a different database like MySQL or PostgreSQL)
Run the application
Run the Spring Boot application, and you should be able to access the Todo list API endpoints at http://localhost:8080/api/todos.

You can use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the API endpoints:

GET /api/todos to retrieve all todo items
POST /api/todos with a JSON payload to create a new todo item
PUT /api/todos/{id} with a JSON payload to update an existing todo item
DELETE /api/todos/{id} to delete a todo item

This is a basic implementation of a Todo list API using Spring Boot. You can further enhance it by adding authentication, validation, error handling, and other features as per your requirements.
