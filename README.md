# TODO_list
Using springboot 
Set up a new Spring Boot project
You can use the Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) to create a new Spring Boot project. Select the following dependencies
Spring Web
Spring Data JPA
H2 Database (for an in-memory database, or you can choose a different database like MySQL or PostgreSQL)
Run the application
Run the Spring Boot application, and you should be able to access the Todo list API endpoints at http://localhost:8080/api/todos.

You can use tools like Postman or cURL to interact with the API endpoints:

GET /api/todos to retrieve all todo items
POST /api/todos with a JSON payload to create a new todo item
PUT /api/todos/{id} with a JSON payload to update an existing todo item
DELETE /api/todos/{id} to delete a todo item


Certainly, here are the steps:

Clone the repository using git clone.
Add the Spring Boot and Java extensions in your IDE.
Add the database credentials in the application.properties file.
Run it on your browser using localhost and port number 8080.

This is a basic implementation of a Todo list API using Spring Boot. You can further enhance it by adding authentication, validation, error handling, and other features as per your requirements.
